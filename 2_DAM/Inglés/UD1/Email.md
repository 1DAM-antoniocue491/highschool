**Dear Sarah,**

Thank you for your message and for explaining your concerns so clearly. You are absolutely right — developing an app for both Android and iOS can be confusing when it comes to hardware. Let me clarify everything for you and suggest the best setup within your budget.

### Understanding the Core Problem

Your developer is correct: to build and test an **iOS app**, they must use **Apple’s Xcode software**, which **only runs on macOS**. Unfortunately, Apple does not allow Xcode to run on Windows, so a **Mac computer is required** for the iPhone part of your project.

This creates a small challenge for multiplatform development: while **Android Studio** (for Android apps) runs perfectly on both Windows and macOS, **Xcode runs only on Macs**. That’s why developers often need access to a Mac — even if they mainly work on Android.

### My Recommended Solution

To keep things simple and cost-effective, I recommend buying **one Apple Mac Mini (M2, 2023 model)**.  
This single machine can handle both **Android Studio** and **Xcode**, allowing your developer to build, test, and publish apps for **both Android and iPhone** without switching computers.

**Suggested configuration:**

- **Model:** Mac Mini (M2, 2023)
- **CPU:** Apple M2 chip (8-core CPU, 10-core GPU)
- **Memory (RAM):** 16 GB Unified Memory
- **Storage:** 512 GB SSD
- **Peice:** Approx. **€1,650** (Apple Store or authorized retailers)

### Why This Is the Best Option

- **One device for both platforms:** It removes the need to buy or rent two computers. The Mac Mini can run Android Studio for Android development and Xcode for iOS development on the same system.
- **Power and efficiency:** The M2 chip and 16 GB of unified memory ensure that heavy tasks—like running Android emulators, compiling code, and testing on virtual devices—run smoothly. With only 8 GB, the system would slow down significantly during emulator use.
- **Future-proof investment:** This Mac will easily support 3–5 years of updates from both Apple and Google development tools.
- **Cost-effective:** Compared to buying both a Windows PC and a Mac, this single solution stays comfortably within your €1,500–€2,000 budget.

### Optional Accessories

If your developer needs a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, you can use any existing peripherals or purchase affordable third-party options (around €200–€250 total).

### In Summary

A **Mac Mini (M2, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD)** is the simplest, most efficient, and budget-friendly workstation for your multiplatform app project. It allows your developer to work productively in both Android Studio and Xcode without any extra hardware or complicated setups.

Please let me know if you’d like me to send a purchase link or compare Mac Mini and MacBook options. I’ll be happy to assist.
