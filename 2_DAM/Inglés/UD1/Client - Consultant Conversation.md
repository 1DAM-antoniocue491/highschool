**Client (B):** Good morning! Thanks for meeting with me. I’m having some serious issues with my IoT system at work.

**Consultant (A):** Good morning! I’m happy to help. Could you describe the problem you’re facing in more detail?

**Client (B):** Sure. I manage a network of smart sensors for environmental monitoring. The problem is high latency — the data takes too long to reach our servers, and by the time it’s processed, it’s already outdated.

**Consultant (A):** I see. That’s a common challenge in IoT systems, especially when data has to travel long distances to the cloud.

It is crucial to understand that latency can be caused by limited bandwidth and excessive reliance on centralized CPU processing. Your sensors might be sending all raw data to the cloud instead of handling some tasks locally.

**Client (B):** Exactly, everything goes directly to our central server. So, what can we do about it?

**Consultant (A):** I recommend implementing an Edge Computing architecture. In this setup, the data is processed by edge devices located closer to your sensors. This reduces latency and improves real-time decision-making.

**Client (B):** That sounds interesting. How does it compare to our current cloud system?

**Consultant (A):** Edge Computing offers a significant advantage over cloud-only systems because it distributes the workload. Instead of depending solely on your central CPU, edge nodes handle pre-processing. You could also upgrade the local nodes with NVMe SSDs and small GPUs to boost performance even more.

**Client (B):** That makes sense. So, the processing will be faster and more efficient, right?

**Consultant (A):** Exactly. Since part of the data is processed locally, you’ll see a noticeable reduction in latency and lower bandwidth usage.

**Client (B):** Great! That seems like the right approach. I’ll start planning the upgrade with my team.

**Consultant (A):** Perfect. Once you deploy the edge devices, we can run a performance test to verify that latency is reduced. Thank you for your time today!

**Client (B):** Thank you for your help!
