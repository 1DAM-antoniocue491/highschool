# **Part 1: Compare and Contrast Storage Drives**
In this section, you will create 10 sentences to compare three different types of storage drives: a traditional HDD, a standard SSD, and a modern NVMe SSD.

| CRITERION         | HDD (Hard Disk Drive)  | SSD (Solid-State Drive)   | NVMe SSD                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Speed**         | Slowest                | Fast                      | Fastest                                |
| **Cost**          | Least expensive        | More expensive            | Most expensive                         |
| **Use Case**      | Data archives, backups | General-purpose computing | High-performance computing, gaming, AI |
| **Noise**         | Noisy (moving parts)   | Silent                    | Silent                                 |
| **Physical Size** | Largest                | Compact                   | Smallest                               |
***Sentences***
1. The HDD disk is slower than NVMe SSD but which is the most expensive disk.
2. The HDD disk is less expensive than SSD because SSD disk is more silent than HDD disk.
3. While M.2 disk is usually used for high-performance computing or AI, the SSD disk is used for general-purpose computing.
4. The M.2 is the smallest disk in the world to use gaming.
5. The SSD and M.2 disks are more silent than HDD because the HDD disk has moving parts.
6. In my opinion, if you want a disk for general purpose but more expensive, you can buy a SSD disk.
7. In HDD disk you can save data and backups because the disk doesn't need to be the fastest.
8. The SSD disk is more expensive than HDD disk yet less expensive than M.2 disk.
9. The M.2 disk is usually used for AI because it is fastest than SSD disk.
10. The HDD disk is slower than SSD disk because it has physical parts that are constantly moving in order to function.

# **Part 2: Case Study.Â The PC Upgrade**  
Read the following scenario carefully and provide a solution.
- **Scenario**: "A client is complaining that their computer is very slow when using a new AI image-generation program. Their PC has an i5 CPU, a standard SSD, and a good GPU. The client wants to know why the program is so slow and what they should upgrade."
- Based on the scenario and the theoretical content from the module, please answer the following questions in complete sentences:
- Identify the Problem: What is the likely hardware issue causing the new AI program to run so slowly?
- Propose a Solution: What specific hardware upgrade would you recommend to the client?
- Explain Your Reasoning: Justify your recommendation. Explain why this upgrade is necessary for modern AI programs and how it will improve the computer's performance for this specific task. You may want to reference the information about specialized processors for AI tasks mentioned in the presentation.

> **Problem**
> 
>    I think that the problem is caused by the standard SSD disk.

> **Solution**
> 
>    When you need to use the AI program in your computer, you should use another SSD that allows you to run the AI program faster than other disks. I recommended that you use a M.2 disk as it's the best option for this purpose.
